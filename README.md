This is my 2015 attempt at MIT's Battlecode competition (battlecode.org). Unfortunately, I stopped a week or so into the month-long competition because school started again.

The code is horribly unstructured and messy. The most updated parts are in path_finder_tests_2 (I have no idea how they got there).
